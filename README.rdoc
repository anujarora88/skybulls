SkyBulls is a simulated trading platform for people who want to educate and train themselves and test their strategies before directly investing in the stock market. The stock data is currently randomly generated. This is the "poker tournament" part of the app, made using Rails, MySql, Bootstrap and Mustache.  To run the app in dev mode, add an entry for skybulls-local.com to your hosts file. The other part of the app is hosted here : https://github.com/anujarora88/skybulls_node
